# Solar-Tracker Using Arduino

Developed an automated system to optimize solar energy capture by tracking the sun’s position using Arduino and Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs).
– Designed a mechanism that continuously monitors light intensity using dual LDR sensors.
– Implemented a control algorithm to adjust a servo motor's position dynamically, ensuring maximum solar panel exposure.
– Developed efficient code using Arduino IDE to process sensor data and control motor movement in real-time.
– Tools & technologies used: Arduino Uno, LDRs, Servo Motor, Breadboard, Arduino IDE, Multimeter, Jumper Wires.
